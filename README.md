# ðŸš€ Python_LeetCode_Solutions

Here, I'll be sharing Python solutions for various LeetCode problems, starting with array and hashing data structures. This repository follows the LeetCode roadmap for problem-solving, gradually covering different data structure patterns.


## LeetCode Roadmap For Beginners 

### Array and Hashing

- **Array Basics**:
     - Master array manipulation techniques like:
       -  Insertion
       -  Deletion
       -  Traversal
  
- **Hashing Techniques**:
    - Hashing involves mapping data to a fixed-size array (hash table) for rapid data retrieval.
    - Explore Hashing Basics, Hash Functions and Hash Set.
  .

### Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked Lists**:
   -  Singly linked lists consist of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
   -   Implement operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal in singly linked lists.
  
- **Doubly Linked Lists**:
    -    Doubly linked lists feature nodes with references to both the next and previous nodes.
    -    Learn to work with doubly linked lists, enabling backward traversal and efficient deletion.

### Trees and Graphs

- **Binary Trees**:
   - Binary trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node, each containing at most two children nodes.
   -  Master binary tree traversal algorithms like:
        -   Inorder Traversal
        -   Preorder Traversal
        -   Postorder Traversal
  
- **Graph Traversal**:
   -  Graphs represent connections between nodes.
   -  Implement depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) for graph traversal.

### Sorting and Searching

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  -   Sorting arranges elements in a specific order.
  -   Understand various sorting algorithms like:
       -   Bubble sort
       -   Selection sort
       -   Insertion sort
  
- **Searching Techniques**:
  -  Searching finds a specific element within a collection.
  -  Learn linear search and binary search.

### Dynamic Programming

- **Memoization and Tabulation**:
  -  Dynamic programming is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and reuses them.
  -  Implement memoization (top-down) and tabulation (bottom-up) techniques for dynamic programming.|
